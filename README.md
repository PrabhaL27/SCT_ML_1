# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **Linear Regression model** to predict the prices of houses based on:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

The goal is to understand how these features influence house pricing using **scikit-learn** and basic data visualization.

## 📁 Dataset

A sample dataset is hardcoded into the program with 7 entries for simplicity:

| Square Feet | Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Price     |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1500        | 3        | 2         | 300000    |
| 1600        | 3        | 2         | 320000    |
| 1700        | 3        | 2         | 340000    |
| 1800        | 4        | 3         | 360000    |
| 2000        | 4        | 3         | 400000    |
| 2100        | 4        | 3         | 420000    |
| 2500        | 5        | 4         | 500000    |
